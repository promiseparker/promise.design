        <h2 class="cs-section__title">Powerful hardware,<br /><em>forgettable software.</em></h2>
        <p class="cs-body">
          Smart lighting hardware has come a long way. The apps controlling it haven't. Most smart home apps are built around the assumption that users want granular control — and present them with dashboards, sliders, menus, and settings that feel better suited to a network router than a living room lamp.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-body">
          The result is that people with perfectly capable smart bulbs end up using a physical switch — not because the app is broken, but because the experience isn't worth the friction. Lumino was a challenge to close that gap: make the software feel as immediate and satisfying as the hardware it controls.
        </p>

            <p class="cs-col__body">
              Existing smart home apps front-load complexity. Users land on room lists, device trees, or app-home dashboards before they've done anything useful. There's no sense of immediacy — no feeling that the app and the physical world are connected.

        <p class="cs-body">
          I started with observation — not surveys. I watched how people actually interact with smart lighting in their homes. The pattern was consistent: nobody opened an app to set a Kelvin temperature. They wanted to make a room feel right, quickly. They thought in terms of what they were doing — reading, relaxing, watching something — not what the bulb was emitting.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-body">
          Interviews reinforced this. Users described their ideal lighting experience in sensory terms: "warmer," "dimmer," "softer." They wanted the app to speak that language. Technical precision mattered to nobody. Immediacy and feedback mattered to everyone.

        <p class="cs-body">
          Lumino was built in React with React Router v7, Tailwind CSS v4, and Motion for animation. The decision to build rather than prototype in Figma was deliberate — spring physics can't be faked in a static file. Real interaction had to be tested with real code.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-body">
          Every transition uses spring physics via the Motion library. Sliders don't snap — they settle. The beam cone doesn't cut from dim to bright — it breathes. The Web Audio API powers subtle haptic-adjacent audio feedback that reinforces physical actions without being intrusive. The result is an interface that has weight. When you interact with Lumino, you feel like you've touched something real.

        <p class="cs-body">
          The central design decision in Lumino is the live beam visualisation. Rather than showing a percentage in a text field or a progress bar, the light's output fills the screen as an animated cone — narrower and paler at low brightness, wide and saturated at full power.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-body">
          The vertical slider on the right edge keeps controls peripheral — present when needed, invisible when not. As you drag, a floating pill callout surfaces the exact percentage, giving precision without cluttering the default view. The beam and the number tell the same story simultaneously.

        <p class="cs-body">
          Colour is where smart lighting apps typically either overwhelm or underwhelm. Lumino's colour system gives full RGB control through a continuous spectrum slider, while offering curated presets — Warm, Daylight, Cool, Ocean, Coral, Lavender — for users who think in moods rather than hex codes.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-body">
          The selected colour renders live in the beam above. There's no "preview" button, no confirmation step before you see the result. The light in the UI is the light in your room — instant, honest feedback. Saving the change is a conscious, deliberate tap — separate from the act of exploring.

        <p class="cs-body">
          Schedules were identified in research as a high-value, low-adoption feature. Users wanted automation but gave up during the setup. The issue wasn't capability — it was the interface. Most smart home apps buried scheduling three levels deep and required understanding concepts like "routines" and "triggers" before a simple timer could be set.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-body">
          Lumino's schedule system is a single list: what time, which action, which days. Adding one takes four taps. The next trigger time is always visible beneath each rule — "Next: Tomorrow, 7:00 AM" — so users know the system is working without having to verify it. Deletion uses a friction-adding confirmation that prevents accidental removals, but doesn't punish deliberate ones.

          Lumino proved that smart home design doesn't have to be a trade-off between power and approachability. The combination of live visual feedback, spring-physics motion, and simplified flows produced a prototype that testers consistently described the same way: "it just feels right."
        </p>
        <p class="cs-body">
          More than a design case study, Lumino is a working artefact — a coded, interactive product that closes the gap between what was designed and what was experienced. Every interaction decision was validated in code, not assumed from a mockup.
