        <p class="cs-body">
          Bayse (formerly GoWagr) posted a product designer role on social media. Instead of sending a generic portfolio, I downloaded the app, used it as a real user would, and documented every friction point I hit. Within a week I had 10 specific problems — each one a barrier between the user and a trade, and between Bayse and revenue.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-body">
          This is a speculative redesign. Nothing here is decoration. Every screen change is a direct response to a specific problem in the existing app, tied to a real user outcome and a business case. Target users: Nigerians, ages 15–80. Competitors studied: Polymarket, Kalshi.

          This was the biggest flow-breaking bug in the app. A user with ₦490 in their account could type ₦1,500, see "Insufficient Funds" on screen, and still tap the active "Review" button — going through the entire review flow only to hit a wall at the end. A completely pointless journey that ends in frustration and a closed app.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-body">
          The fix is precise: if you don't have enough, the Review button is disabled. You're told exactly how much more you need, and there's a "Deposit" button right there — at the moment you want to spend money — to add funds instantly.

          Bayse's target audience is Nigerians aged 15–80. Most of them have never used a prediction market.

The new design adds a clean second toggle — Market / Limit — on the right side of the header. Buy is blue. Sell is red. The colour coding does the work before the user even reads the label. Switching to Limit reveals a dedicated Limit Price field, keeping the interface uncluttered until it's needed.

          If you own shares, your position is now visible directly on the market card — "Yes · 8 shares" inline next to the candidate — with a "Sell X Yes shares" button right there. No navigation required. If you have no shares: a clear empty state with a "Switch to Buy" CTA. If you do own shares: you see exactly how many, their current value, and percentage-based sell chips (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) that make choosing an amount immediate.

          The information on the old Review screen was already good — Spending, Payout, fees, estimated shares, profit if correct. The problem wasn't what was there, it was how it looked. The old layout was flat and transactional, visually disconnected from the redesigned buy flow it sat at the end of. This was about bringing it into line: giving Payout the visual dominance it deserves, surfacing the zero-fee message as a confidence signal rather than a quiet table row, and making the whole screen feel like it was designed at the same time as everything else.

          The old chart tooltip showed raw percentages — "43.52%", "24.79%", "18.28%" — with no candidate names attached.

The new chart labels every line directly in the tooltip by candidate name, so you always know exactly what you're reading. Time filters were also reordered logically (12H → 1D → 1W → 1M → ALL), and key stats — trade count and volume — now sit below the chart as a quick read.

        <p class="cs-body">
          Every one of these 10 changes ties directly to the same two outcomes: make it easier for users to trade, and make more money for Bayse. The fixes range from a single button state (disabling Review when funds are insufficient) to a full feature addition (Comments). But none of them are cosmetic. Each one removes a specific reason a user might stop, leave, or lose trust — and replaces it with a reason to stay and trade.
        </p>
        <p class="cs-body">
          Bayse has a real product with real traction. The underlying idea — prediction markets built for Nigerian culture — is strong. What it needs is a UX that matches that ambition. This redesign is my argument for what that looks like.
